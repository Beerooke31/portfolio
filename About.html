      Hi there and hello! Thank you for stopping by. <br />I'm a fullstack
      developer currently expanding my knowledge in all things Javascript (it
      <br />
      really can do it all - don't listen to the naysayers).
      <br />
      One of my favourite pastimes is sitting down to do some programming when
      <br />
      the buzzing in my brain gets to be too much. <br />
      If you'd like to discuss how me combatting the wilderness of my mental
      state through coding <br />can be an asset to you or your business, please
      get in touch!
    </p>
